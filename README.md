# Logo_OIBSIP
(Task 2)

I've used Canva software to build the assigned task.
With the use of gradient lines I've made the logo, which I personally use for any design that I make.
It can be cross-checked on my X-handle @1Ash07.
The logo says "AD" namely - 'Ash Designs' as the naming tagline.
Ive kept the whole thing very simple, on a blackout bg, and used glow shadow effect on the tagline as highlight.
I've merged the gradient lines at the end for the outcome.
